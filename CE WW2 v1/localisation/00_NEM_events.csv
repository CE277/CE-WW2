EVTDESC22586;The Great Depression was a severe worldwide economic depression that took place mostly during the 1930s, beginning in the United States. The timing of the Great Depression varied across the world; in most countries, it started in 1929 and lasted until the late 1930s.

However, the fate of both Tacna and Arica was to be decided by a plebiscite to be held in 1893. Due to different points of view, both countries were not able to agree on the conditions of this plebiscite and so it was not held. Chile began then to colonize the two territories and Peru answered with a break of diplomatic relations.

EVTDESC21101;As World War II ended, Romania, a former Axis member, was occupied by the Soviet Union, the sole representative of the Allies. On 6 March 1945, after mass demonstrations by communist sympathizers and political pressure from the Soviet representative of the Allied Control Commission, a new pro-Soviet government that included members of the previously outlawed Romanian Workers' Party was installed. Gradually, more members of the Workers' Party and communist-aligned parties gained control of the administration and pre-war political leaders were steadily eliminated from political life. In December 1947, King Michael I was forced to abdicate and the People's Republic of Romania was declared.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC21102;The Romanian Revolution was a period of violent civil unrest in Romania during December 1989 as a part of the Revolutions of 1989 that occurred in several countries. The Romanian Revolution started in the city of Timissoara and soon spread throughout the country, ultimately culminating in the show trial and execution of longtime Communist Party General Secretary Nicolae Ceausescu and his wife Elena, and the end of 42 years of Communist rule in Romania. It was also the last removal of a Marxist-Leninist government in a Warsaw Pact country during the events of 1989, and the only one that violently overthrew a country's leadership and executed its leader.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;

Many of these missionaries established school and printing presses in Beirut which catered to the city's Christian population. Despite this recent surge, education was not a new concept for Lebanese Christians. A Syriac printing press was established in 1610 and Jesuits founded a school in 1624. American missionaries began their efforts in 1834 with another printing press and school. By the mid 1840s, it was noted by American missionaries that between a quarter and a third of men in Lebanon were literate and by the beginning of the 20th century nearly half of all Lebanese children could read, a feat which was hardly matched anywhere outside of the West at the time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;

Neither the Republic of Turkey nor the Soviet Union was established at the time. The internationally recognized Turkish government at the time was that of Sultan Mehmed VI, but it was not party to the Treaty of Moscow. The latter had signed the Treaty of Sevres, which had been repudiated by the Turkish National Movement. Under the Treaty of Moscow, the two governments undertook to establish friendly relations between the countries. Article VI of the Treaty declared all the treaties theretofore concluded between Russia and Turkey to be null and void; under Article II, Turkey ceded Batum and the adjacent area north of the village of Sarp to Georgia. Article III instituted an autonomous Nakhichevan district under Azerbaijan's protectorate; under Article V, the parties agreed to delegate the final elaboration of the status of the Black Sea and the Straits to a future conference of delegates of the littoral states provided that the "full sovereignty" and security of Turkey and "her capital city of Constantinople" were not injured. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;

While these were widely seen to presage a "federal Europe," the focus of constitutional debate shifted to the later, 2007, Treaty of Lisbon.

EVTDESC16050232;The Northern Expedition was a military campaign launched by the National Revolutionary Army (NRA) of the Kuomintang (KMT), also known as the "Chinese Nationalist Party", against the Beiyang government and other regional warlords in 1926. The purpose of the campaign was to reunify China, which had become fragmented in the aftermath of the Revolution of 1911. The expedition was led by Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek, and was divided into two phases. The first phase ended in a 1927 political split between two factions of the KMT. The right-leaning Nanjing faction, led by Chiang, and the left-leaning faction in Wuhan, led by Wang Jingwei. The split was partially motivated by Chiang's purging of communists within the KMT, which marked the end of the First United Front.

Following the incident, conservative KMT elements carried out a full-scale purge of Communists in all areas under their control, and even more violent suppression occurred in Guangzhou and Changsha.

EVTDESC110050;Guided Democracy was the political system in place in Indonesia until the New Order began. It was the brainchild of President Sukarno, and was an attempt to bring about political stability. He believed that Western-style democracy was inappropriate for Indonesia's situation. Instead, he sought a system based on the traditional village system of discussion and consensus, which occurred under the guidance of village elders. Sukarno proposed a threefold blend of nasionalisme ('nationalism'), agama ('religion'), and komunisme ('communism') into a co-operative 'Nas-A-Kom' government. This was intended to appease the three main factions in Indonesian politics — the army, Islamic groups, and the communists. With the support of the military, he proclaimed, 'Guided Democracy' - western-style parliamentary democracy was thus finished in Indonesia until the Reformasi era.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Some, like civil rights leader Ralph Bunche, the NAACP, and the editorial page writers of The Washington Post and The New York Times called the Riverside Church speech a mistake on King's part. The New York Times editorial suggested that conflating the civil rights movement with the anti-war movement was an oversimplification that did justice to neither, stating that "linking these hard, complex problems will lead not to solutions but to deeper confusion." Others, including James Bevel, King's partner and strategist in the Civil Rights Movement, called it King's most important speech.

EVTNAME23485;The Thirty-second Nobel Prize In Physics;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC23485;A $COUNTRY_ADJ$ physicist performed a series of experiments showing that the gamma ray hypothesis for an experiment conducted in Paris was untenable. He repeated the creation of the radiation using beryllium, used better approaches to detection, and aimed the radiation at paraffin following the Paris experiment. Paraffin is high in hydrogen content, hence offers a target dense with protons, since neutrons and protons have almost equal mass, protons scatter energetically from neutrons. He measured the range of these protons, and also measured how the new radiation impacted the atoms of various gases. He found that the new radiation consisted of not gamma rays, but uncharged particles with about the same mass as the proton: these particles were neutrons. In $YEAR$ he was nominated and won the Nobel Prize in Physics "for the discovery of the neutron".;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTDESC23483;A $COUNTRY_ADJ$ physicist developed an equation in quantum mechanics that bears his namesake. The equation is a partial differential equation that describes how the quantum state of a physical system changes with time. It was formulated in late 1925, and published in 1926. In $YEAR$, he was nominated and won the Nobel Prize in Physics "for the discovery of new productive forms of atomic theory".;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME23482;The Thirtieth Nobel Prize In Physics;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC23482;A $COUNTRY_ADJ$ physicist published a puzzling paper. The main new idea, non-commuting matrices, is justified only by a rejection of unobservable quantities. It introduces the non-commutative multiplication of matrices by physical reasoning, based on the correspondence principle, despite the fact that he was not then familiar with the mathematical theory of matrices. In a series of experiments with other scientists, he solved problem of the quantum behavior by two different methods. First, he treated the system with the virtual oscillator method, calculating the transitions between the levels that would be produced by the external source. He then solved the same problem by treating the anharmonic potential term as a perturbation to the harmonic oscillator and using the perturbation methods that he had developed. In $YEAR$ he won the Nobel Prize in Physics "for the creation of quantum mechanics, the application of which has, inter alia, led to the discovery of the allotropic forms of hydrogen".;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTDESC23480;During a voyage in 1921, a $COUNTRY_ADJ$ physicist noticed the blue color of glaciers and the Mediterranean sea. He was motivated to discover the reason for the blue color. He carried out experiments regarding the scattering of light by water and transparent blocks of ice which explained the phenomenon. In an experiment, je employed monochromatic light from a mercury arc lamp which penetrated transparent material and was allowed to fall on a spectrograph to record its spectrum. He detected lines in the spectrum and he presented his theory at a meeting of scientists in $CAPITAL$ on 16 March 1928, and won the Nobel Prize in Physics in $YEAR$ "for his work on the scattering of light and for the discovery of the effect named after him".;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTDESC23479;"The fundamental idea of my 1924 thesis was the following: The fact that, following the introduction of photons in light waves, one knew that light contains particles which are concentrations of energy incorporated into the wave, suggests that all particles, like the electron, must be transported by a wave into which it is incorporated... My essential idea was to extend to all particles the coexistence of waves and particles discovered in 1905 in the case of light and photons".

EVTDESC23478;In 1901, a $COUNTRY_ADJ$ demonstrated that the current from a heated wire seemed to depend exponentially on the temperature of the wire with a mathematical form similar to the Arrhenius equation. This became known as a law that takes his namesake: "If then the negative radiation is due to the corpuscles coming out of the metal, the saturation current s should obey the law". In $YEAR$, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics "for his work on the thermionic phenomenon and especially for the discovery of the law named after him".;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTDESC23477;A $COUNTRY_ADJ$ scientist, particularly interested in meteorology, in 1893 began to study clouds and their properties. He worked for some time at the national observatory, where he made observations of cloud formation. He then tried to reproduce this effect on a smaller scale in the laboratory in $CAPITAL$, expanding humid air within a sealed container. He later experimented with the creation of cloud trails in his chamber caused by ions and radiation. For the invention of the cloud chamber he received the Nobel Prize in $YEAR$, officially "for his method of making the paths of electrically charged particles visible by condensation of vapor", dividing the honor with another scientist "for his discovery of the effect named after him".;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME23476;The Twenty-fifth Nobel Prize In Physics;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC23476;In 1895, a $COUNTRY_ADJ$ scientist showed that cathode rays were of negative electric charge in nature. He determined Avogadro's number (now known as the Avogadro constant) by several methods. He explained solar energy as due to the thermonuclear reactions of hydrogen. His most famous work is, however is his theoretical explanation of Brownian motion in terms of atoms. He did the experimental work to test and verify another scientist predictions, thereby settling the century-long dispute about John Dalton's atomic theory. He received the Nobel Prize in Physics in $YEAR$ for this and other work on the discontinuous structure of matter, which put a definite end to the long struggle regarding the question of the physical reality of molecules. Officially, his award mentions "for his work on the discontinuous structure of matter, and especially for his discovery of sedimentation equilibrium".;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME23475;The Twenty-fourth Nobel Prize In Physics;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC23475;Two $COUNTRY_ADJ$ scientists developed an experiment, which took their name, and that was the first electrical measurement to clearly show the quantum nature of atoms and thus "transformed our understanding of the world". They designed a vacuum tube for studying energetic electrons that flew through a thin vapor of mercury atoms. They discovered that, when an electron collided with a mercury atom, it could lose only a specific quantity (4.9 electron volts) of its kinetic energy before flying away. This energy loss corresponds to decelerating the electron from a speed of about 1.3 million meters per second to zero. A faster electron doesn't decelerate completely after a collision, but loses precisely the same amount of its kinetic energy. Slower electrons just bounce off mercury atoms without losing any significant speed or kinetic energy. In $YEAR$ they were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics "for their discovery of the laws governing the impact of an electron upon an atom".;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME23474;The Twenty-third Nobel Prize In Physics;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC23474;A $COUNTRY_ADJ$ scientist developed improved experimental apparatus which allowed him to make very accurate measurements of the X-ray wavelengths produced by atoms of different elements. He developed a convention for naming the different spectral lines that are characteristic to elements in X-ray spectroscopy that gained his name. His precision measurements drove many developments in quantum theory and atomic physics and "for his discoveries and research in the field of X-ray spectroscopy" he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in $YEAR$.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME23472;The Twenty-first Nobel Prize In Physics;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC23472;A $COUNTRY_ADJ$ scientist developed a model of the atom which takes his name, in which he proposed that energy levels of electrons are discrete and that the electrons revolve in stable orbits around the atomic nucleus but can jump from one energy level (or orbit) to another. He conceived the principle of complementarity: that items could be separately analyzed in terms of contradictory properties, like behaving as a wave or a stream of particles. The notion of complementarity dominated his thinking in both science and philosophy. In $YEAR$, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics "for his services in the investigation of the structure of atoms and of the radiation emanating from them".;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME23471;The Twentieth Nobel Prize In Physics;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC23471;Based on calculations a $COUNTRY_ADJ$ scientist made in 1911, about his new theory of general relativity, light from another star would be bent by the Sun's gravity. In 1919 that prediction was confirmed by Sir Arthur Eddington during the solar eclipse of 29 May 1919. Those observations were published in the international media, making the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ scientist world famous. On 7 November 1919, the leading British newspaper The Times printed a banner headline that read: "Revolution in Science – New Theory of the Universe – Newtonian Ideas Overthrown". In $YEAR$, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics "for his services to Theoretical Physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect", as his theory of relativity was still considered somewhat controversial.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME23470;The Nineteenth Nobel Prize In Physics;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC23470;A $COUNTRY_ADJ$ physicist discovered a nickel-steel alloys he named invar and elinvar. Invar has a near-zero coefficient of thermal expansion, making it useful in constructing precision instruments whose dimensions need to remain constant in spite of varying temperature. Elinvar has a near-zero thermal coefficient of the modulus of elasticity, making it useful in constructing instruments with springs that need to be unaffected by varying temperature, such as the marine chronometer. Elinvar is also non-magnetic, which is a secondary useful property for anti-magnetic watches. His work got him a Nobel Prize in Physics in $YEAR$, "in recognition of the service he has rendered to precision measurements in Physics by his discovery of anomalies in nickel steel alloys".;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTDESC23469;A well accomplished $COUNTRY_ADJ$ physicist, that published more than 300 papers, mainly regarding electricity and other such topics, discovered an effect that got his namesake and that is described as "the shifting and splitting of spectral lines of atoms and molecules due to presence of an external electric field". Additionally, "for his discovery of the Doppler effect in canal rays and the splitting of spectral lines in electric fields" he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in $YEAR$.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME23468;The Seventeenth Nobel Prize In Physics;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC23468;At first, the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ physicist considered that quantization was only "a purely formal assumption ... actually I did not think much about it...", nowadays this assumption, incompatible with classical physics, is regarded as the birth of quantum physics and the greatest intellectual accomplishment of his career. The discovery of the constant that was named after him enabled him to define a new universal set of physical units (such as the length and the mass, both named after hi,), all based on fundamental physical constants upon which much of quantum theory is based. In recognition of his fundamental contribution to a new branch of physics, Quantum Physics, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in $YEAR$, officially "in recognition of the services he rendered to the advancement of Physics by his discovery of energy quanta".;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTNAME23465;The Fifteenth Nobel Prize In Physics;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC23465;A $COUNTRY_ADJ$ scientist at the University of $CAPITAL$, working with X-rays, invented the X-ray spectrometer and with his son, a research student at $CAPITAL$, founded the new science of X-ray crystallography - a tool used for identifying the atomic and molecular structure of a crystal, in which the crystalline atoms cause a beam of incident X-rays to diffract into many specific directions. By measuring the angles and intensities of these diffracted beams, a crystallographer can produce a three-dimensional picture of the density of electrons within the crystal. From this electron density, the mean positions of the atoms in the crystal can be determined, as well as their chemical bonds, their disorder and various other information. Together with his son he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in $YEAR$ "for their services in the analysis of crystal structure by means of X-rays".;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME23464;The Fourteenth Nobel Prize In Physics;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC23464;A $COUNTRY_ADJ$ physicist at the Institute for Theoretical Physics, on a walk through a garden in $CAPITAL$ in January, was discussing with a PhD student about the student's thesis topic. The wavelengths of concern to the student were in the visible region of the spectrum and hence much larger than the spacing between the resonators in his crystal model. The physicist seemed distracted and wanted to know what would be the effect if much smaller wavelengths were considered. In June, they reported to the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Physics Society on the successful diffraction of x-rays, for which he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics, in $YEAR$, "for his discovery of the diffraction of X-rays by crystals".;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME23463;The Thirteenth Nobel Prize In Physics;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC23463;A $COUNTRY_ADJ$ physicist exploited the Hampson-Linde cycle to investigate how materials behave when cooled to nearly absolute zero. On 10 July 1908, he was the first to liquefy helium, using several precooling stages and the Hampson-Linde cycle based on the Joule-Thomson effect. This way he lowered the temperature to the boiling point of helium (-269 °C, 4.2 K). By reducing the pressure of the liquid helium he achieved a temperature near 1.5 K, the coldest temperatures ever achieved on earth. His production of extreme cryogenic temperatures led to his discovery of superconductivity in 1911: for certain materials, electrical resistance abruptly vanishes at very low temperatures. His work was recognized with the award of the thirteenth Nobel Prize In Physics "for his investigations on the properties of matter at low temperatures which led, inter alia, to the production of liquid helium" in $YEAR$.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTDESC23461;While studying streams of ionized gas, a $COUNTRY_ADJ$ scientist, in 1898, identified a positive particle equal in mass to the hydrogen atom. This particle was accepted and named the proton. He also formulated an expression for the black-body radiation which is correct in the photon-gas limit. His arguments were based on the notion of adiabatic invariance, and were instrumental for the formulation of a field some scientists are calling quantum mechanics. In $YEAR$, "for his discoveries regarding the laws governing the radiation of heat", he was awarded the eleventh Nobel Prize in Physics.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTDESC23460;A $COUNTRY_ADJ$ scientist, in his dissertation "On the continuity of the gas and liquid state", derived the equation of state bearing his name. His work gave a model in which the liquid and the gas phase of a substance merge into each other in a continuous manner. It shows that the two phases are of the same nature. In deriving his equation of state, he assumed not only the existence of molecules (a disputed topic) but also that they are of finite size and attract each other, one of the first scientists to postulate an intermolecular force. His work was recognized and in $YEAR$ he was awarded the tenth Nobel Prize in Physics "for his work on the equation of state for gases and liquids".;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME23457;The Seventh Nobel Prize In Physics;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC23457;A $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Midshipman, fascinated with the sciences and the problem of measuring the speed of light in particular, conducted his first experiments of the speed of light, as part of a class demonstration in 1877. His experiment was refined, and in 1879, he measured the speed of light in air to be 299,864 ± km/s and estimated the speed of light in vacuum as 299,940 km/s. After two years of studies in Europe, he resigned from the Navy in 1881. In 1883 he accepted a position as professor of physics at the University of $CAPITAL$ and concentrated on developing an improved interferometer. In 1887 he carried out an experiment which seemed to rule out the existence of the aether. He later moved on to use astronomical interferometers in the measurement of stellar diameters and in measuring the separations of binary stars. Finally, in $YEAR$, he won the seventh Nobel Prize in Physics "for his optical precision instruments and the spectroscopic and metrological investigations carried out with their aid".;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTDESC23456;"As the cathode rays carry a charge of negative electricity, are deflected by an electrostatic force as if they were negatively electrified, and are acted on by a magnetic force in just the way in which this force would act on a negatively electrified body moving along the path of these rays, I can see no escape from the conclusion that they are charges of negative electricity carried by particles of matter... If, in the very intense electric field in the neighborhood of the cathode, the molecules of the gas are dissociated and are split up, not into the ordinary chemical atoms, but into these primordial atoms, which we shall for brevity call corpuscles, and if these corpuscles are charged with electricity and projected from the cathode by the electric field, they would behave exactly like the cathode rays".

EVTDESC110011;The English Anglo-Persian Oil Company was the first company to extract petroleum from $COUNTRY$. In 1901 William Knox D'Arcy negotiated an oil concession with Mozaffar al-Din: he would assume exclusive rights to prospect for 60 years in a vast tract of territory and in exchange the Shah received 20,000¤, an equal amount in shares, and a promise of future profits. In early May 1908 D'Arcy, having sunk more than 500,000¤ into his Persian venture and found no oil, sent a telegram saying that they had run out of money and ordering to "cease work, dismiss the staff, dismantle anything worth the cost and come home."

Initially, the federal government ordered the Yugoslav People's Army to secure border crossings in Slovenia. Slovenian police and Slovenian Territorial Defence blockaded barracks and roads, leading to stand-offs and limited skirmishes around the republic. After several dozen casualties, the limited conflict was stopped through negotiation at Brioni on 7 July 1991, when Slovenia and Croatia agreed to a three-month moratorium on secession.

EVTDESC34014;The Brioni Agreement or Brioni Declaration is a document signed by representatives of Slovenia, Croatia, and Yugoslavia under the political sponsorship of the European Community (EC) on the Brijuni Islands on 7 July 1991. The agreement sought to create an environment in which further negotiations on the future of Yugoslavia could take place. However, ultimately it isolated the federal prime minister Ante Markovic in his efforts to preserve Yugoslavia, and effectively stopped any form of federal influence over Slovenia. This meant the Yugoslav People's Army (JNA) would focus on combat in Croatia, creating a precedent of redrawing international borders and staking the EC's interest in resolving the Yugoslav crisis.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTDESC50003;Juscelino Kubitschek, president of Brazil from 1956 to 1961, ordered Brasilia's construction, fulfilling the promise of the Constitution and his own political campaign promise. Building Brasilia was part of Juscelino's "fifty years of prosperity in five" plan. Already in 1892, the astronomer Louis Cruls, in the service of the Brazilian government, had investigated the site for the future capital. Lucio Costa won a contest and was the main urban planner in 1957, with 5550 people competing. Oscar Niemeyer was the chief architect of most public buildings, Joaquim Cardozo was the structural engineer, and Roberto Burle Marx was the landscape designer.

EVTDESC50004;The Constitutionalist Revolution of 1932 is the name given to the uprising of the population of the Brazilian state of Sao Paulo against the Brazilian Revolution of 1930 when Getulio Vargas assumed the nation's Presidency. Vargas was supported by the people, the military and the political elites of Minas Gerais, Rio Grande do Sul and Paraiba. The movement grew out of local resentment from the fact that Vargas ruled by decree, unbound by a Constitution, in a provisional government. The 1930 Revolution also affected Sao Paulo by eroding the autonomy that states enjoyed during the term of the 1891 Constitution and preventing the inauguration of the governor of Sao Paulo Julio Prestes in the Presidency of the Republic, while simultaneously overthrowing President Washington Luis, who was governor of Sao Paulo from 1920 to 1924. These events marked the end of the First Republic. Vargas appointed a northeasterner as governor of Sao Paulo.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC50007;The Communist uprising of 1935 was a military revolt by leftist low-rank military against Getulio Vargas's government, in the name of the National Liberation Alliance and with the support of the Brazilian Communist Party, which was back then called the Communist Party of Brazil, the uprising also had the support of the Comintern. It was the last of a series of Brazilian military uprisings which began on 1922 under the name of tenentismo or the lieutenants revolts. Later, Vargas used it as a pretext for the Estado Novo establishment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC50010;In 1938, the Integralists made a last attempt at achieving power, by attacking the Guanabara Palace during the night, but police and army troops arrived at the last minute, and the ensuing gunfight ended with around twenty casualties. This attempt was called the Integralist "Pajama Putsch".;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC50013;The events related to Brazilian participation in the war and the ending of the conflict in 1945 strengthened pressures in favour of redemocratisation. Although there were some concessions by the regime, such as the setting of a date for presidential elections, amnesty for political prisoners, the freedom to organize political parties, and a commitment to choose a new Constitutional convention, Vargas was not able to retain support for the continuation of his presidency and was deposed by the military in a surprise coup launched from his own War Ministry on October 29, 1945.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC50014;The 1964 Brazilian coup d'etat colloquially known in Brazil as the Coup of 64, was a series of events in Brazil from March 31 to April 1 that led to the overthrow of President Joao Goulart by members of the Brazilian Armed Forces, supported by the United States government. The following day, with the military already in control of the country, the speaker of the Brazilian Congress came out in support of the coup and endorsed it by declaring vacant the office of the presidency (though Goulart never officially resigned). The coup put an end to the government of Goulart, a member of the Brazilian Labour Party, who had been democratically elected vice president in the same election in which conservative Janio Quadros, from the National Labour Party and backed by the National Democratic Union, won the presidency.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTDESC97693;Formed on May 12, 1936, the Mongol Military Government  had Prince Yondonwangchug of Ulanqab as its first chairman. It was renamed in October 1937 as the Mongol United Autonomous Government. On September 1, 1939, the predominantly Han Chinese governments of South Chahar and North Shanxi were merged with the Mongol United Autonomous Government, creating the new Mengjiang United Autonomous Government. The capital was established at Zhangbei, near Kalgan, with the government's control extending around Hohhot. On August 4, 1941, it was again renamed the Mongolian Autonomous Federation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97694;The early 20th century saw a period of Taisho democracy (1912–1926), but the 1920s saw a fragile democracy buckle under a political shift towards statism, the passing of laws against political dissent and a series of attempted coups. This process accelerated during the 1930s, spawning a number of new Radical Nationalist groups which shared a hostility to liberal democracy and a dedication to expansion in Asia. Japanese expansionism and militarization along with the totalitarianism and ultranationalism reshaped the country.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTDESC13185;A group of western expatriates currently residing in $CAPITAL$ have offered an invitation to high-ranking members of the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government to attend a fancy affair in the legation quarter.

EVTDESC13186;A group of $COUNTRY_ADJ$ entrepreneurs recently spent time plying $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ officials with fine wine and favors at a formal affair in $FROMCOUNTRY$'s legation quarter.

EVTNAME97153;The Spanish Royal Commissary;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97153;A Spanish deputy by the name of Eusebio de Salazar y Mazaredo has arrived to negotiate with the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government regarding the Talambó incident. The problem, however, is that he carries with him the title of Royal Commissary. This is a title reserved for officials dealing with Spanish colonies, not ambassadors to sovereign nations. This is a deliberate insult to $COUNTRY$!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME97155;Submitting to Spain;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97155;We have been overrun by Spain, and now have no choice but to surrender our sovereignty to our former colonial overlords. It is a bitter day.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT97155OPTA;Our time shall come again.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME97156;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Submits;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97156;An envoy from $FROMCOUNTRY$ has arrived with the expected news: they have agreed to submit themselves to Spanish rule once again, if we so choose. Some might wonder if it's worthwhile for Spain to involve itself in South American affairs, particularly since they will ultimately try to rebel out from under us. Perhaps we have proven our point?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT97156OPTA;They've been taught their lesson.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTNAME97160;The Return of the Imperialists;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97160;Spanish imperialism has raised its head once again, with the Spanish throne having gone to war with a neighbour in an effort to restore their lost influence. The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ people are rightfully worried at what this means, and there are calls for us to take a stand.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT97160OPTA;We do not want to get involved.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVT97161OPTA;So be it.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME97165;Appeal to America?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97165;The United States claims it intends to protect the New World from encroachment from imperial powers in Europe. Now that Spain has made its imperialist intentions evident, perhaps it is time we put the so-called Monroe Doctrine to the test?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT97165OPTA;No. We will stand on our own.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT97165OPTB;Ask the Americans for help.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME97166;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Requests Aid;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97166;The Monroe Doctrine dictates that the United States is responsible for protecting the western hemisphere from encroachment from imperialists in Europe -- such as what Spain is doing right now in South America. $FROMCOUNTRY$ has put the Monroe Doctrine to the test and appealed to us for aid, asking for an alliance in case Spain should decide to expand its influence even further.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTNAME97050;The Peru-Bolivian Confederation;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97050;The confederation of Peru, South Peru and Bolivia represents a threat to our interests. If the confederation is given time to solidify, they could easily become a new powerhouse in South America -- and one that is no friend to $COUNTRY$. Thankfully there are signs that the confederation is unstable: the Peruvians chafe at the Bolivian leadership, and given enough incentive they might withdraw. If we act now, we might be able to stir our people against them.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT97050OPTA;The PBC must fall.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTNAME500057;Swiss Banking;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC500057;Swiss mercenaries brought home funds from their contracts that helped Swiss banks begin. Banking began in the eighteenth century by way of the riches of merchants and Wegelin & Co., established in 1741, is the oldest bank in our nation.

EVTNAME46303;War of the Farrapos;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTNAME700013;Recognizing Paraguay's Independence;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC700013;The Congress of Paraguay formulated and declared an unilateral declaration of independence from the Argentine Confederation. While the provinces long had self rule, they were nominally part of Argentina. Now with the formalization of their independence, the Paraguayan government is asking from an official recognition from us.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTOPT700013A;We recognize Paraguay's independence.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTOPT700013B;We refuse to recognize their independence.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME97666;The Rebellion is Over;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97666;Saigo Takamori is dead -- some say he committed seppuku after receiving a wound -- and the rebellion he inspired is now ended. To many, this was the last gasp of the ancient samurai... and a new way for $COUNTRY$ on the path of progress now lies ahead.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT97666OPTA;Then it is done.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME97680;The Sakhalin Question;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97680;Japan has quarreled with Russia before over the rule of Sakhalin Island. Now, our influence in China and Korea has led to renewed friction between our nations. The Line of Advantage dictates that we must extend our control over the whole of Sakhalin and establish a stronger northern border. But are we willing to risk war with a European power?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT97680OPTA;Demand the island, or it is war!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT97680OPTB;This is not in our interests at this time.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME97681;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ Demand;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97681;The warmongers in the Japanese government are now demanding that Russia cede Sakhalin and the Kuril Islands entirely to them. To give up so much territory without a fight would make us look very weak, but Japan's might has grown tremendously in recent decades. Can we risk a war in the Pacific?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT97681OPTA;The islands aren't worth a war.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT97681OPTB;Of course we will fight for the motherland!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME97676;War With $FROMCOUNTRY$!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVT97676OPTA;We shall resist!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME97677;The Korean Question;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97677;Our nation's policy of the Line of Advantage dictates that we must expand our borders if we are to maintain security. Naturally, our most vulnerable point lies in neighboring Korea. They must either be brought under our direct control or made into a vassal if $COUNTRY$ is to be kept safe. Already $COUNTRY_ADJ$ generals are clamoring for war.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT97677OPTA;We should take advantage while we can.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT97677OPTB;This is not in our best interest.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME97678;The Formosa Question;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97678;The recent murder of Japanese sailors off the coast of Formosa has given rise to a question within the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government: should we use this excuse to step in and wrest control of the southern island? The Line of Advantage is clear, dictating that the land would be invaluable to our goals. But are we willing to risk such a war?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT97678OPTA;Demand the island, or it is war!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVT97679OPTA;We cannot fight them.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT97679OPTB;This insult cannot be borne!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97627;The shogun's Chief Minister has been assassinated by ronin samurai outside the very gates of Edo castle! Though the ronin were either cut down or committed seppuku, a manifesto found on their bodies makes it clear their act was a reaction to the recent purge instigated by the Chief Minister against agitators within the shogunate. This is a clear sign that upheaval against the bakufu has reached an unacceptable point, yet the shogunate refuses to compromise with the imperial court. Many are certain this will only speed up the coming conflict.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT97627OPTA;This is most unfortunate.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME97630;The Death of Emperor Komei;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97630;There are some who believe that Emperor Komei was assassinated -- delivered a handkerchief laced with smallpox, perhaps by radicals who fear the possibility of compromise between the bakufu and the imperial court. No matter the truth, the death of the Emperor has placed the young Emperor Meiji upon the imperial throne and eliminated any chance of compromise.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT97630OPTA;We welcome the new emperor.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME97635;Opposition to the Bakufu;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97635;There is a growing restlessness among the daimyo, with some whispering that the Tokugawa shogunate has grown weak and is unable to deal with the encroachment of foreign powers. Officials within the bakufu are urging that we seek allies among either the outsider tozama or the traditional fudai, to strengthen the shogunate's position. Approaching one means angering the other, of course, but it appears we have little choice.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT97635OPTA;We will seek allies among the southern tozama.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTNAME97660;The Taisho Era;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97660;With the ascension of Emperor Taisho, whose poor health has prompted a shift in political power from Japan's old guard to the Imperial Diet, democratic parties are beginning to see their influence spread throughout the country. Though democratic tradition is not deeply rooted, the idea of enfranchisement as a right of the individual Japanese citizen has become far more broadly accepted. Students, university professors and journalists inspired by Western schools of thought have organized public demonstrations to demand new reforms.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTNAME97674;The Line of Advantage;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97674;The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government has followed a policy of progress and westernization until now, hoping that advancing $COUNTRY$ to match the Western powers would keep us safe.

EVTDESC10140_NEW;Liberal causes have started to gain traction in $COUNTRY$. While no one knows for sure, rumor has it that the root cause of this sudden upswing in liberal propaganda efforts is the recent foundation of a secret society, forced into hiding due to the persecution of any legitimate opposition to the ruling party.

But the British claim they are willing to compromise and have been pushing for an established border along the Columbia River which they believe would be a fair solution and help both nations avoid another costly war.

Now, combining personal magnetism with religious zealotry, he begun a war to unify the tribes in western and central Sudan, determined to expel us and restore Islam to its primitive purity. While the local government in Khartoum initially dismissed this man, further reports indicate the Mahdi possesses a great deal of magnetism -- and his rallying call of driving all foreign presence out of the Sudan has gained him a large following.

EVTDESC36710;In a meeting mediated by the British, the Netherlands has offered to sign a treaty which would see them relinquish all claims to Belgian territory -- but at the cost of surrendering Luxembourg to them as a vassal.

EVTDESC36715;Despite our best efforts, the unthinkable has happened: Amsterdam has fallen. It seems there is little choice but to surrender to the Belgians and allow them to dictate terms.

EVTDESC44305;Perhaps inspired by the American Revolution, colonists in both the Lower Canada and Upper Canada colonies have risen up in rebellion.

EVTDESC44320;A bill has been passing through the British Parliament which would see the entirety of Rupert's Land -- all North American colonial territory between British Columbia and Ontario -- being given offered to the Canadian dominion.

Both sides have agreed that our borders in the Kuril Islands lay just north of Etorofu, and propose to share sovereignty over Sakhalin Island.

EVTNAME32522;Trouble in Sakhalin;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC32522;Conflict is brewing in Sakhalin. Shared sovereignty has failed, and with no official border between the Russian and Japanese claims, settlers from both sides now fight over territory. For stability's sake, we must clearly define our borders, once and for all. There are several solutions we could propose: first, we could officially divide the island between us and Japan, essentially legalizing the status quo. This would be generous of us, and it would improve our relations with Japan. Second, we could push for full control of Sakhalin, offering in return to concede the northern Kuril Islands and make resettlement payments to those displaced. This would represent a modest profit, but Japan might not agree to it. Finally, we could demand full control of Sakhalin and offer nothing in return. This would hurt our reputation, and it would badly offend the Japanese, who would probably refuse. How should our diplomats proceed?;;;;;;;;;;;;x

The Russian recently approached us, all smiles and willingness to co-operate. They have offered to make the current status quo official: Sakhalin will have a border drawn dividing it in two.

Shared sovereignty has failed, and with no official border between the Russian claims and ours, settlers from both sides now fight over territory. For stability's sake, we must clearly define our borders, once and for all. Now the Russians have proposed an exchange of border territories: we would give them complete control of Sakhalin, and in return they would cede the northern Kuril Islands all the way to Kamchatka. Russia has also offered to make resettlement payments to help Japanese to relocate from Sakhalin. We can accept their proposal, or we can insist on preserving the present borders in Sakhalin.If we accept, we will lose a modest territory but improve relations with Russia. On the other hand, if we insist on the status quo, we will keep our present territory but risk escalating the conflict.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,

Their negotiators hint darkly at Russian ships shelling Japanese ports if we should refuse. We can accept their proposal, or we can insist on preserving the present borders in Sakhalin.

EVTDESC330006;The Great Depression provided a political opportunity for Hitler. Germans were ambivalent about the parliamentary republic, which faced challenges from right- and left-wing extremists. The moderate political parties were increasingly unable to stem the tide of extremism, and the German referendum of 1929 helped to elevate Nazi ideology.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC330007;Hitler has caused quite a commotion in our country, with many people aligning their beliefs with his!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC330008;The Reichstag fire was an arson attack on the Reichstag building, home of the German parliament in Berlin, on Monday 27 February 1933, precisely four weeks after Adolf Hitler was sworn in as Chancellor of Germany. Hitler's government stated that Marinus van der Lubbe, a Dutch council communist, was culprit, and they attributed the fire to communist agitators in general—though a German court decided later that year that Van der Lubbe had acted alone, as he claimed. After the fire, the Reichstag Fire Decree was passed. The Nazi Party used the fire as a pretext that communists were plotting against the German government, and the event is considered pivotal in the establishment of Nazi Germany. The term "Reichstag fire" has come to refer to false flag actions facilitated by an authority to promote their own interests through popular approval of retribution or retraction of civil rights.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC330009;The Tripartite Pact, also known as the Berlin Pact, was an agreement between Germany, Italy and Japan signed in Berlin on 27 September 1940 by, respectively, Joachim von Ribbentrop, Galeazzo Ciano and Saburo Kurusu. The Tripartite Pact was directed primarily at the United States. Its practical effects were limited, since the Italo-German and Japanese operational theatres were on opposite sides of the world and the high contracting powers had disparate strategic interests. Some technical cooperation was carried out, and the Japanese declaration of war on the United States propelled, although it did not require, a similar declaration of war from all the other signatories of the Tripartite Pact.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTDESC98200;The Boers are descendants of Dutch settlers in the eastern Cape Colony, and they have never sat well with British rule. More and more of them are leaving their farmsteads and moving to the east and the north-east, encroaching on territory traditionally ruled by the Xhosa and the Basotho. Conflict with those native peoples appears to be inevitable, as perhaps is conflict with the Boers themselves should we allow any lands they claim to remain independent. As far as the British government is concerned, the Boers are British subjects... no matter where they go.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The ones heading east are encroaching on Zulu territory, however, and it seems there is no end to them.

There have been several altercations with British military forces, and the recommendation of the colonial government is that Natal be annexed before the situation grows worse. If we do not, then we must allow the Boers to find their own way -- and suffer the loss to our prestige this would entail.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTDESC98255;Once again, conflict with the native Xhosa has flared into violence in our Cape Colony.

EVTNAME98256;The Final Straw;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC98256;We have received reports from the Cape Colony that there has been yet another outbreak of violence between the Xhosa natives and the colonials. This time it is evidently caused by natives returning from the diamond mines, attempting to take back control of their lands without any consideration for due process. Many within the Cape Colony believe it is time that the military moved in and took over their lands completely.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTNAME85000;Catholics Slain in Korea;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC85000;There has been increasing violence against French missionaries in Korea, recently culminating in the execution of Bishop Siméon-François Berneux -- head of the fledgling Korean Catholic Church -- and the subsequent killing of almost all priests in the country as well as thousands of Catholic Koreans. One surviving priest fled to the Qing Empire, relaying his tale to a French war vessel which then launched a punitive expedition with the support of the French consul in Beijing. There is a call for France to go to war against Korea -- but this is complicated by the fact that Korea is a tributary state of the Qing. If we press the matter, we risk war with the Koreans' master, but if we back down it will be a great blow to our prestige.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT85000OPTA;This cannot go unpunished.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTDESC85001;The foolish Koreans have begun executing Catholics within their territory, and this has included a number of $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ missionaries -- and now the French have demanded retribution. The problem, naturally, is that Korea is a Qing tributary. We are obligated to come to the Korean's defense, even if this means war with $FROMCOUNTRY$. Of course, there are those who say the Koreans have brought this on themselves. We would lose little sleep if we left them to their own devices, and earn favor with the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In a fury, our ship returned fire and then landed a party to battle the Koreans on land. After victory, they returned home -- but word of the assault has spread. This is yet another example of Korea flaunting its disrespect for $COUNTRY_ADJ$ authority. Many within the government are suggesting we demand not only an apology, but force a treaty upon the Koreans which will see their nation forced to open itself to our influence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT85010OPTA;Demand an apology as well as the treaty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTDESC85011;A $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ vessel, surveying the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ coastline and damaged by a storm, was drawing near Ganghwa Island in search of safe harbor when it was fired on by the coastal fortress -- who assumed the vessel to be an enemy. In a fury, their ship returned fire and then landed a party to battle our forces on land. They returned home victorious, but words of the assault has spread and now a $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ delegation has arrived in $CAPITAL$ to demand compensation -- in the form of an unequal treaty requiring $COUNTRY$ be opened to their influence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Japanese returned home victorious, but words of the assault has spread and now we hear tale that they have forced the Koreans to sign an unequal treaty in consequence... one which has forced them to sever tributary ties to $COUNTRY$.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTNAME98620;Christian Oppression;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC98620;The Ottoman government had a number of policies regarding the treatment of Christians within the Empire which were considered oppressive: the capitulation tax, known as the Jizya, as well as controls over Christians which did not permit them to become soldiers or hold public office. It was not until the Hatt-i Humayun in 1856 -- also known as the Imperial Reform Edict, part of the Tanzimat Reforms -- that things actually began to improve for minorities.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTNAME98626;The Empire in Crisis;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC98626;The current state of unrest within the Empire has reached the point where the Sultan has been advised to abrogate the Ottoman Constitution. Absolute power must be returned to the monarchy in order to stamp out the militants -- and while there are those who say that such action will only foster more unrest, there are others who are all too aware that failing to do so will make the Sultan look weak. It is not beyond the realm of possibility that reactionaries might seek to restore the monarchy by force -- or, even worse, seek to abolish it altogether.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT98626OPTA;Order must be restored. Abrogate the constitution.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTNAME98630;Inspired Nationalists;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC98630;With the recent loss of European territories, nationalists within $COUNTRY$ have been inspired to rise up. $COUNTRY_ADJ$ officials are concerned we could be seeing a string of rebellions in the years to come, and already the army is scrambling to contain any efforts at rebel organization.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTNAME98635;The Young Turks;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC98635;Spurred on by the continuing lack of reform, Ottoman liberals have radicalized into the 'Young Turks'. They seek to restore the constitutional monarchy, by force if need be, and there are those who have advised the government that these liberals must be dealt with harshly before they grow into a real problem.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT98635OPTA;We cannot allow them to spread unrest.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT98635OPTB;Let them talk.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTDESC98636;Turkish liberals have grown increasingly defiant of the Ottoman monarchy -- to the point where they suggest that the Sultan must be overthrown, replaced with a modern republic. They reject the notion of Ottomanism, saying it has already led to the Empire's decline, and that the way to restoring the nation's glory is to put the good of the Turkish people ahead of all other concerns... including religious.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTDESC37219_NEW;The Paris Foreign Missions Society has been actively spreading Catholicism in Asia for many years now, but they have encountered considerable persecution at the hands of Asian authorities. In Dai Nam, the execution of several missionaries has prompted the society to ask the French government for diplomatic intervention.

EVTDESC37230;The island of Tahiti in the Pacific Ocean, ruled by the primitive Queen Pomare IV," expelled two French catholic priests several years ago.

Proponents of laissez-faire economics are adamant that the market will provide food for those affected, and that the government should not interfere in private enterprise.

EVTDESC95639;The Paris Foreign Missions Society has been actively spreading Catholicism in $COUNTRY$ for many years now, or perhaps we should say they are attempting to, as they have encountered considerable resistance among the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ people.

EVTDESC95640;The Paris Foreign Missions Society has been actively spreading Catholicism in Asia for many years now, but they have encountered considerable persecution at the hands of Asian authorities. In $FROMCOUNTRY$, the execution of several missionaries in the Cochinchina region has prompted the society to ask the French government for diplomatic intervention.

EVTDESC95641;First they send their 'missionaries' into our country, flouting our laws and offending our people with their spouted nonsense.

EVTNAME95645;The Suzerainty of Cambodia;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC95645;We have an issue before us. The Vietnamese rule over our kingdom, and it seems certain that, very soon, either they or the Thai will demand we submit in full and are swallowed whole. The French stand on our borders, eyeing Indochina with their own ambitions. Perhaps they will make kinder rulers?

EVTDESC95646;King Norodom of Cambodia has sent our government a request: he asks that the French intervene in his nation, demanding it be released from Vietnamese control and made our protectorate. This would suit our goals in Indochina, though it risks war.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC95647;Cambodia has been under Vietnamese control since our war with Siam. Now it seems the Cambodia king has approached the French and asked for protection, and the French have agreed to offer it. They are demanding control over Cambodia, on threat of war.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVT95650OPTA;It remains a possibility.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTDESC95652;French diplomats have arrived in $CAPITAL$ with a set of demands: namely that we should surrender control of all eastern territories not 'rightfully ours'.

EVT95652OPTA;We have no choice. Surrender the territory.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT95652OPTB;Never! They will have to take it from us!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME95653;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Has Refused;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTDESC95655;We are in a difficult situation. $COUNTRY_ADJ$ forces cannot hold out against the French onslaught, and they plague us at every opportunity.

EVTNAME185;$COUNTRY_ADJ$ Prohibition?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC185;The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Temperance League has been increasingly active in one of our states this year, with a campaign to harass local public houses and liquor merchants.

EVT185OPTB;Nonsense. They take this too far.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME186;$COUNTRY_ADJ$ Libertines;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC186;The libertine culture in $COUNTRY$ has drawn criticism, with news of a scandal that reaches to the very heights of government. Several ministers are accused of unsavory dealings, and there are calls in $CAPITAL$ for the government to support religious groups in their calls for moderation and temperance.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT186OPTA;There is no need for such action.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT186OPTB;Some restraint is best.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME18210;The Right to Vote;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC18210;A bill has come before the government in $CAPITAL$ regarding the current enfranchisement offered to the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ people. The discussion so far has been that expanding the voter base has led only to problems, and this bill would tighten the restrictions on voting... to the point where entire groups of people would have their voting rights removed. Passing the bill would no doubt cause problems, but the government seems determined to do so.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT18210OPTA;Let the bill pass.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT18210OPTB;That will cause too many problems.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTNAME18215;Party Loyalty?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC18215;A group of the ruling elite in $CAPITAL$ has recently become very concerned at reforms which have made it possible for members of the government to hold views outside of party policies. These reforms have made things too lax, they say, and will ultimately lead to the demise of $COUNTRY$. They've succeeded in gathering enough clout to pass a bill strengthening the power of the party whips, and ensuring that the party's influence in the government remains absolute.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT18215OPTA;We must have unity in the government.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT18215OPTB;No. Let the government rule as it desires.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME18220;The Right to Information;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC18220;A bill has come before the government in $CAPITAL$ regarding the rights of the press. Many feel that the reforms have allowed the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ newspapers to become combative with the government, inciting dissension and making the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ people harder to control. This control is necessary, they say, if $COUNTRY$ is to remain strong and united. While some might be upset by the bill's passing, the government appears entrenched in its position.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME18225;The Right to Gather;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC18225;A bill has come before the government in $CAPITAL$ regarding the rights of the people to gather. Many feel that reforms have allowed the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ people to become too liberated -- they gather in crowds, protesting the government and otherwise stirring the rest of the rabble. Once upon a time, they say, this simply wouldn't have been allowed. New rules must be put in place to limit the number of people that can meet in one place, and for what purpose. While some might be upset by the bill's passing, the government appears entrenched in its position.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT18225OPTA;They are right. We cannot abide this sort of rabble-rousing.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT18225OPTB;No, the rules shall stay as they are.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME18230;Rights of the Opposition;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC18230;Members of the ruling party have been busy within the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government, slowly changing small rules that would make it difficult for opposition parties to get recognized and elected. Political boundaries have been shifted, and in some cases members of the opposition have even been harassed. Now it seems a bill has been put before the government which would entrench a large number of these rules, making them permanent. The government is adamant, saying the rules are needed to keep stability in $COUNTRY$, though the bill will no doubt be incredibly unpopular among the liberals.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME18231;Pro-War speech;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC18231;Members of the right-wing parties are trying to encourage the country's army and people to cope with the difficult war the country is facing. We must support the difficult struggle of the military as this war will be decisive for the future of the country on the world stage.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME18232;Anti-War speech;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC18232;Members of the ruling party believe the country should reconsider its role in this war. War will bring adverse material and financial conditions for the country and is a bad thing for the future of all citizens.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME98600;$COUNTRY_ADJ$ Independence?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC98600;There has been an increasing desire among the people of $COUNTRY$ to gain our full independence. Crowds gathering in $CAPITAL$ have demanded an end to rule by our distant overlords, and while many in the government are sympathetic with their cries there are also those who fear such a demand could lead to war. Any attempts to achieve independence should ideally take a diplomatic route first, with friendly ties maintained if peaceful separation becomes a reality.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT98600OPTA;We will make the request.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT98600OPTB;There is no point.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME98605;$FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ Independence?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC98605;Diplomats from $FROMCOUNTRY$ arrived in $CAPITAL$ this month, presenting a formal request for their full independence from $COUNTRY$. They assure us that they fully intend to maintain ties with our nation, and have agreed to move forward as $COUNTRY_ADJ$ allies, but that they desire their freedom even so. There are many who feel such a request is beyond the pale and must be refused out of hand. Still others say that if $FROMCOUNTRY$ is denied, we could be facing a rebellion -- and is it not better than to have a friendly ally than a recalcitrant and unwilling subject?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT98605OPTA;Grant $FROMCOUNTRY$ its freedom.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT98605OPTB;Refuse them.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME98606;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Has Refused;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC98606;Not unexpectedly, the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government has denied our request for independence. It seems our only option is rebellion -- as unrealistic as some claim that option to be.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT98606OPTA;How unfortunate.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME98607;$COUNTRY$ Granted Independence;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC98607;Our diplomacy has proven successful: $COUNTRY$ has been granted full autonomy, on the condition that friendly ties be maintained with $FROMCOUNTRY$. Crowds have gathered in $CAPITAL$ to cheer on our Independence Day!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT98607OPTA;We are most fortunate.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC98608;It appears the threat of a war of independence was enough to secure $COUNTRY$'s freedom. Crowds have gathered in $CAPITAL$ to cheer on our Independence Day!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME98610;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Demands Independence;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC98610;It appears the time for diplomacy has ended. We have received word from the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government that they have demanded independence -- or it will be war.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT98610OPTA;Then it is war!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT98610OPTB;We shall let them go. For now.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME98611;Must We Fight Alone?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC98611;Since $COUNTRY$ was denied its independence, there has been talk of open rebellion in the streets of $CAPITAL$. Fighting against our overlords might surely result in us being crushed, however. Since we have no recourse, secretly approaching some of the enemies of our overlord might gain us some allies in the war to come.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT98611OPTA;Attempt to find allies... quietly.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT98611OPTB;There is no need for this.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTDESC98612;Representatives from $FROMCOUNTRY$ have quietly approached us, asking to set up an alliance with $COUNTRY$ should their demand for independence go unheeded. So far, they say, diplomatic efforts have proven fruitless... so $COUNTRY_ADJ$ assistance would be invaluable to them, and perhaps gain us a new ally.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT98612OPTA;Agree to the alliance.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT98612OPTB;No, this is too risky.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTNAME97175;Chaos in $STATENAME$;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97175;The rebellion in $STATENAME$ has been going on for far too long, and we are in danger of losing control of the colony entirely. Local militants in $PROVINCENAME$ have gone so far as to declare their nation's independence... and while that isn't yet true, as $STATENAME$'s state of chaos is still far too widespread, it's an embarrassment to $COUNTRY$ and,  given enough time, the militants might gain enough control to earn the colony's independence.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT97175OPTA;This cannot be allowed.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME97180;Return of Our Lands;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97180;Rebels in a neighboring colony have destabilized it enough that the people there are calling out for $COUNTRY$ to restore order. This is our land, and it seems that the western powers have all but abandoned it to chaos. So why shouldn't we intervene? Still, there are some who say this will only damage our relationship with a power... one we cannot afford to anger.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT97180OPTA;We will assume control.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT97180OPTB;It is too risky.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME97181;Colonial Uprising in $STATENAME$;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTNAME19365;The Restoration of $COUNTRY$;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC19365;An idea has been spreading among the people of $COUNTRY$... some of our lands are under foreign control, but it appears to be beyond our power to regain them on our own. $COUNTRY$ has a great power as its benevolent protector, however, does it not? The people are urging our government to approach them for aid, though some within the government are concerned this could possibly alienate our ally as well, not to mention stir up new hostility with our neighbors.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT19365OPTA;We will approach our protector.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT19365OPTB;We will leave the matter alone for now.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME19366;The Restoration of $FROMCOUNTRY$;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC19366;Diplomats from $FROMCOUNTRY$ have quietly approached us, appealing for help in restoring their lost lands. With $COUNTRY_ADJ$ help, they say, $FROMCOUNTRY$ will prove a much worthier ally. There are those concerned with the trouble this might stir up, however. Should we look the other way, prove $COUNTRY_ADJ$ influence has weight?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT19366OPTA;Tell them we shall consider it.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT19366OPTB;We cannot afford such a conflict.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME19367;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Has Agreed;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC19367;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has agreed to consider our proposal. It's possible they will, in the end, take no military action on our behalf… it's come to our attention that relations between them and one of our neighbors has cooled severely, however, so a war may yet come to pass.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT19367OPTA;Then there is hope.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME19368;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Has Refused;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC19368;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has refused to intervene on our behalf. Worse, it appears the purpose of our mission has leaked to at least one of our neighbors, angering them greatly bringing threats of war against $COUNTRY$. Did $FROMCOUNTRY$ inform them?

EVTNAME19370;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ Overlords;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC19370;$FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ soldiers marched into $CAPITAL$ today, accompanying the new $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ governor who will be overseeing the operation of the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ puppet government. Already the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ people are up in arms over this imposition by a foreign power, though some are clearly questioning whether there is anything to be done. $COUNTRY$ did not submit willingly, after all, and if a rebellion breaks us free of $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ control would they not simply invade once again? Perhaps $COUNTRY$ has suffered enough.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT19370OPTA;A sad day for $COUNTRY$.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME19301;The Dream Is Over;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC19301;There was once a dream in this country - a dream of a land of liberty, of new opportunities. People would flock to the United States of America seeking freedom, opportunities and shelter from the horrors of war and intolerance of the old world. The Statue of Liberty, the USA proudest symbol, used to symbolize that, and that was the first thing immigrants saw when entering our country. The Statue is still there, standing ominously in the bay of New York, but it doesn't represent that dream anymore, nor any of the values it used to. With the recrudescence of the institutions in our country, the change from a democratic government, the Statue lost all meaning and people from all over the world stopped being enchanted by what it represented. \n \n The dream is over.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTOPTA19301;Who needs immigrants anyway?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC19006;Our independence is gradually being undercut and more and more becoming something that only exists on paper, as several foreign Great Powers vie for control over our political institutions. Recently, tensions have erupted between several great powers each vying for dominance over our government. If any of them attempts to assert themselves in $COUNTRY$, it will mean conflict with our government, the other great powers, and possibly even war.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC19007;Tensions between ourselves and other Great Powers have erupted regarding dominance over the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government. We are forced into a position where we must either assert our position, which will be seen as undercutting $FROMCOUNTRY$'s independence, or back down and lose much of the influence in $FROMCOUNTRY$ we currently hold.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTNAME37236;The Construction of the Eiffel Tower;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC37236;Work on the foundations of the Eiffel Tower began. Those for the east and south legs were straightforward, each leg resting on four 2 m (6.6 ft) concrete slabs, one for each of the principal girders of each leg but the other two, being closer to the river Seine, were more complicated: each slab needed two piles installed by using compressed-air caissons 15 m (49 ft) long and 6 m (20 ft) in diameter driven to a depth of 22 m (72 ft) to support the concrete slabs, which were 6 m (20 ft) thick. Each of these slabs supported a block built of limestone each with an inclined top to bear a supporting shoe for the ironwork. Each shoe was anchored into the stonework by a pair of bolts 10 cm (4 in) in diameter and 7.5 m (25 ft) long. The foundations were complete by $YEAR$ and the erection of the ironwork began. For this part, we need to set a budget for the construction.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT37236OPTA;Invest more than is planned.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTNAME37237;The Eiffel Tower Is Finished;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC37237;The main structural work was completed at the end of March 1889 and today Eiffel celebrated this by leading a group of government officials, accompanied by representatives of the press, to the top of the tower. Since the lifts were not yet in operation, the ascent was made by foot, and took over an hour, Eiffel frequently stopping to make explanations of various features. Most of the party chose to stop at the lower levels, but a few, including Nouguier, Compagnon, the President of the City Council and reporters from Le Figaro and Le Monde Illustré completed the climb. At 2:35 Eiffel hoisted a large French flag, to the accompaniment of a 25-gun salute fired from the lower level. There was still work to be done, particularly on the lifts and the fitting out of the facilities for visitors, and the tower was not opened to the public. The tower was an immediate success with the public, and nearly 30,000 visitors made the 1,710-step climb to the top using the stairs before the lifts entered service.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTNAME3697000;The Construction of the Clock Tower;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC3697000;During the rebuilding of the Palace of Westminster in the wake of the fire of 1834, the parliament determined that the new buildings should incorporate an impressive clock tower and passed a bill to that end in $YEAR$. This clock tower will take years to be built but it will be a massive accomplishment for out country. The only thing left for the building to start is to define the budget.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME3697001;The Clock Tower Is Finished;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC3697001;The completion of the Clock Tower marks the end of the reconstruction of the Palace of Westminster. The clock tower was constructed on the northern extremity of the new Houses of Parliament that were built next to Westminster Hall. The commission for the clock itself demanded a high level of accuracy, the specifications drafted by the Royal Astronomer required that "the first stroke of the hour bell should register the time, correct to within one second per day, and furthermore that it should telegraph its performance twice a day to Greenwich Observatory, where a record would be kept." The second and final version of the hour bell was the largest ever cast in the UK. It was so colossal that a team of 16 horses was needed to pull the wagon upon which it rested from the foundry to the Tower. The transportation took on the character of a parade, with enthusiastic crowds lining the streets as the caravan made its way through London. The bell and tower got nicknamed "Big Ben".;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTNAME95502;The Age of Colonialism;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC95502;Word has reached $COUNTRY$ of a great meeting of colonial powers in Europe, wherein it was decided that African nations would be divided up amongst them -- as if our people were little more than children's toys discarded and left waiting to be picked up. This has caused a great deal of concern among those of our people with the knowledge to understand what this means. For others it has brought little more than resentment, as well as vows to fight for our independence when the day comes.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Europeans believe we are not civilized, and the tone of our contact with them is slowly changing from friendly interest in trade to a strange paternalism coupled with cultural superiority. For now, $COUNTRY$ survives... but we must watch for the moment when the civilized nations decide our enslavement is the only way we can be 'saved'.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTDESC95505;European presence in $COUNTRY$ is felt everywhere. Their traders come to $CAPITAL$ and dictate to our own merchants how trade will commence. They take what they want and pay what they wish. They tell our government what laws we may pass, and even when they do not we must always consider how they will react to what we do. If $COUNTRY$ does not act now, they will turn our nation into a colony under our very noses -- but perhaps that has already happened, and we must resign ourselves to their protection.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTNAME11115;The Greater Slavic Union;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC11115;Many within $COUNTRY$ have always considered it a dream to form a greater union of the Slavic peoples, one spanning all of the Balkans and uniting them under a common flag. Such a nation would be far better suited at resisting the encroachment of foreign powers into the region. Now seems like the perfect opportunity for $COUNTRY$ to form such a union. Do we proceed with the creation of Yugoslavia, or let the dream die here?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT11115OPTA;We will attempt to form the union.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTNAME11110;A North German Union?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC11110;An open discussion amongst liberals in $COUNTRY$ has been occurring regarding the formation of a confederation of North German states. Conditions have never been right for it in the past, but many believe such a union is needed if the Germans are ever to have true security and take their place among the powers of the world. A $COUNTRY_ADJ$-led movement to create such a confederation might go over well with our neighbors, if we made the attempt to create it.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTDESC11104;A pro-$UNION_ADJ$ revolution has taken hold in $FROMCOUNTRY$. Its liberal leaders believe that $COUNTRY$ is the nation best-suited to unite all of $CULTURE_GROUP_UNION$, and thus have sworn to support us until the union is ready to occur.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTDESC880130;Rumors were around for some time, but a newspaper has finally published evidence of a wide-reaching scandal affecting the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ reactionary party. Aristocrats have allegedly been receiving payments and other illegal benefits for supporting the cause, while the party leader is shown to have made a fortune with sensitive national information. This has been declared beyond the pale even by reactionary supporters and has caused a huge uproar within $COUNTRY$, severely damaging the reactionary cause in $COUNTRY$.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTDESC880140;Rumors were around for some time, but a newspaper has finally published evidence of a wide-reaching scandal affecting the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ conservative party. Party leaders were allegedly paid secretly by local land owners to tweak laws in their favor, governmental positions given to favourites, goods stolen from  government warehouses - the list goes on and on. This has been declared beyond the pale even by conservative supporters and has caused a huge uproar within $COUNTRY$, severely damaging the conservative cause in $COUNTRY$.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME880150;Liberal Party Rocked by Scandal;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC880150;Rumors were around for some time, but a newspaper has finally published evidence of a wide-reaching scandal affecting the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ liberal party. Popular candidates have allegedly been involved in smuggling of illicit goods, used questionable tactics to buy votes and speculated on investments with government funds. This has been declared beyond the pale even by liberal supporters and has caused a huge uproar within $COUNTRY$, severely damaging the liberal cause in $COUNTRY$.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME880160;Anarcho-Liberal Party Rocked by Scandal;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC880160;Rumors were around for some time, but a newspaper has finally published evidence of a wide-reaching scandal affecting the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ anarcho-liberal party. Several wealthy businessmen evaded taxes with the help of party members, who in return received kickbacks and a great deal of illegal funding for the party. This has been declared beyond the pale even by anarcho-liberal supporters and has caused a huge uproar within $COUNTRY$, severely damaging the anarcho-liberal cause in $COUNTRY$.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTDESC880170;Rumors were around for some time, but a newspaper has finally published evidence of a wide-reaching scandal affecting the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ socialist party. Illegal union activity, blackmail of important citizens, mistreatment of servants - the facts speak for themselves.

EVTNAME880180;Communist Party Rocked by Scandal;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC880180;Rumors were around for some time, but a newspaper has finally published evidence of a wide-reaching scandal affecting the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ communist party. While preaching water for the masses, important communist party officials appear to drink wine. Police has secured several party coffers filled with dirty money from illegal activities, stolen art and counterfeit documents. This has been declared beyond the pale even by communist supporters, severely hurting the communist cause in $COUNTRY$.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME880190;Fascist Party Rocked by Scandal;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC880190;Rumors were around for some time, but a newspaper has finally published evidence of a wide-reaching scandal affecting the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ fascist party. A militant group associated with the fascists was revealed to have murdered several socialist politicians, tortured priests and attempted to burn the mansion of a wealthy minority leader. This has been declared beyond the pale even by fascist supporters and has caused a huge uproar within $COUNTRY$, severely damaging the fascist cause.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME880200;Grave Consequences;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC880200;As more and more evidence against the ruling party has come to light, the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government has declared it has no choice but to resign and call an election. The decision was made after several weeks of heated debate, and it is already well-known that certain members of the government -- those most sorely hit by the scandal -- have been repudiated by the ruling party and will not be seeking re-election. How this will affect the government's chances is so far unknown.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME880210;New Evidence Worsens Scandal;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC880210;Investigation of the current party scandal by the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ press has brought to light a number of interesting facts. It seems that abuse of power and influence goes well beyond what was initially revealed. Only the surface of this affair has been touched so far, and God only knows what might turn up within the next few weeks. No-one in $COUNTRY$ appears to be discussing anything else at the moment, and already there are calls in the press for the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government to step down.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME999000;National Debate: Trade Policy;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC999000;The intensive election campaign has reached the boiling point in $COUNTRY$, where a fierce trade policy debate pits the friends of free trade against the pals of protectionism in a rough rumble-and-tumble to determine the future of our nation's traders. Free-traders argue that goods must be allowed to freely cross all borders, while protectionists argue that our nation's fragile industries need protection from dangerous foreign competition threatening to undo them. Which path will $COUNTRY$ tread, as it decides on: Free trade, or Protectionism?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTOPTA999000;Our trade must be protected from destructive foreign competition!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTDESC999002;'The morality and virtue of our people have started to decline!' This statement caused much stir among the debaters of toleration and religious plurality. They have started to question the country's view on religion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTOPTA999002;There are no Gods!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTNAME999003;National Debate: Citizenship Policy;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC999003;Two debaters are arguing heatedly about their views. The rest of the hall sits dumbfounded when words like aliens, minorities, ethnic and cultural groups are thrown between the two. One wish that immigrants should adapt to the dominant culture while the other believes that they should retain their cultural heritage.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTOPTA999003;Give them residency.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTNAME999004;National Debate: War Policy;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC999004;Patriots and pacifists are fighting in the town house, using words to hurt and kill their enemies. A long since dead and buried dispute between $COUNTRY$ and its neighbour has once again shown its ugly head. Patriots wish to invade the country while pacifists believe that there are other ways to resolve the dispute.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTOPTA999004;We are patriots and we are going to fight for our country!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTOPTB999004;Violence can be used, but in this situation it would be meaningless.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTNAME999010;The Political Campaign Of $YEAR$;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC999010;The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ political parties have begun a nationwide election campaign. So far, the effects have been quite limited, but in the end, one party will gain the upper hand. Advisors state that we could try to influence the outcome ourselves.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTNAME999020;Calm Elections;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC999020;The remaining election campaign of $YEAR$ has been unusually quiet. The political parties have had no pressing issues which have gripped the country's attention,  and the election seems to be passing without any national debates or events.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTOPTA999020;There shall be peace and quite in our time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME999021;Violent Elections;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC999021;The election campaign of $YEAR$ has been unusually violent. Only a few days after the campaign had begun, the first incidents started. Strikes occurred in several large factories, with incidents of street fighting in most major cities. Paramilitary groups have threatened voters of opposing ideologies, while radicals have staged attacks on political enemies. The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ police are tirelessly to get the situation under control, but it looks as if $COUNTRY$ is in for a contentious election.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTOPTA999021;Outrageous!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME999022;Riots!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC999022;The tensions from the current election campaign have escalated, with disorder spreading fast in $CAPITAL$ and spreading elsewhere. Advisors are recommending that the military be brought into the capital to restore order, though doing so will only contain the violence at best.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTNAME999034;The Anarcho-Liberals;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC999034;It looks like the anarcho liberals, a group of radicals who have taken the liberal ideals to their extreme, have discovered a talent in the current election to find the right words when and where they are needed: All over $COUNTRY$ their new agenda has persuaded a lot of people to join their cause.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME999035;The Social Liberals;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC999035;A new breed of $COUNTRY_ADJ$ liberals has become very active in the current election -- educated liberals who believe equally in both social and political reform. They have been actively campaigning for people to support both, and have been attracting a lot of attention.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME999036;Reactionary Surge;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC999036;There are a large number of people, particularly among the ruling elite of $COUNTRY$, who believe that liberal attitudes have been responsible for all of the country's ills. They advocate controls on immigration and a repeal of voting rights. They also appear to have charismatic speakers, for they seem to be gathering a lot of attention in the current election.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME999037;Surge of Conservatism;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTNAME999040;National Debate: Voting Rights;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC999040;'Why should only the rich be allowed to vote? We also pay taxes, so why shouldn't we have something to say in politics?' \n\nThe industrial revolution has empowered the middle class. More and more businessmen are making more and more money. It seems only natural that they demand voting rights.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTOPTA999040;They are right - support their reform.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTOPTB999040;Voting rights for the middle class? Nay!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTOPTC999040;A reform is long past due - issue a new voting right.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTDESC999041;'...and mind you, we even pay way higher taxes then they do! Still, their votes are worth more than ours - I ask you: is that really fair?' While being allowed to vote, the middle class feels diminished by the current weighted voting rights, and the subject has been repeatedly raised in the current election.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTOPTA999041;Sounds like a good idea, I guess.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTOPTB999044;There is no need to change the system.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTDESC999045;'Why are they allowed to change the rules during an election? Drawing random borders to scatter those who won't vote for them is not fair. It is fraud, I tell you! They divided our district between four others, because they knew how we would vote. FRAUD!

EVTOPTA999045;You are right, we have to do something.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTOPTB999045;Want me to play the world's smallest violin?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTNAME999049;National Debate: Unemployment;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC999049;The election is almost over, but liberals and socialists are still arguing about the current state of affairs. Unemployment is a problem, but both sides have decisive arguments for what they think has to be done.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTOPTA999049;The liberals are right!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTNAME999050;Unemployment Issues;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC999050;Unemployment is still an important issue in $COUNTRY$, but all our recent attempts to crate new jobs have failed. During the election of $YEAR$, communists and fascists argued that their dogma is the only one that will give work to the people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTDESC999055;A recent mine accident that led to the deaths of five children, all labourers working under the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ child labor laws, has led to a national debate over the issue. Children wearing protest signs have shown up at political debates, causing quite a stir and raising the question over whether the government should consider reform.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME999056;The Rights of Minorities;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC999056;A demonstration by minorities in $CAPITAL$, denouncing the fact that 'universal suffrage' in $COUNTRY$ does not include them, has drawn attention throughout the country and sparked debates over whether minorities should be given the right to vote. Reactionaries are incensed at the idea, claiming that only 'true' $COUNTRY_ADJ$ citizens should decide its government.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME999057;The Immigration Issue;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC999057;Immigration has long been a thorny issue in $COUNTRY$, with many citizens maintaining the opinion that allowing too many foreigners into the country leads to chaos and unemployment. $COUNTRY$ should be for the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ people, and no others. Despite this, the plight of immigrants who are longing to be reunited with family currently located elsewhere has received a great deal of attention in the current election. There have been demonstrations by liberals in $CAPITAL$ calling for immigration reform.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME999060;War Dominates the Election;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC999060;So far the war has dominated talk in the election, with a number of jingoistic politicians rousing the people with fiery speeches. 'We must protect $COUNTRY$!', they cry. '$COUNTRY$ must be mighty!' It seems they are being listened to, as so far they have enjoyed success throughout the country.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME999061;Talk of War;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC999061;While $COUNTRY$ is not currently at war, there are those who think it should be. 'They are ripe for the picking, and $COUNTRY$ must strike now! While we are strong!' They are referring to one of our hated neighbors, who some jingoists feel should be a target for expansion. Permitting such talk will make us look aggressive to the international community, however, though it may also be an opportunity of which to take advantage.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME999065;The Slavery Debate;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC999065;A recent incident involving the death of several slaves at the hands of their owner has gained national attention in the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ election, with both sides pouncing on the debate. Abolitionists say that this is but one more example of slavery being responsible for the inhumane treatment of one's fellow man. Proponents claim this is a matter for the courts to resolve, and accuse the Abolitionists of stirring up an isolated incident.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTNAME31510;A Greater Austrian Destiny?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC31510;Austrians have always walked a path slightly apart from those of their fellow Germans, and the notion of greater unification has never caught on in Austria as it has in the north. Lately there are those who say Austria's unquestioned dominance obligates it to unite Greater Germany under a single flag. Still others say that, no, Austria already has its own name and empire, one that stretches over many cultures who would never welcome becoming more dominated by the Germans... not to mention that a Greater Germany would alarm the powers of Europe to such a degree it would almost surely herald a war. Thus the question arises: what shall our path be?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME31511;Limited Autonomy for $COUNTRY$;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC31511;We have been granted limited self-government by $FROMCOUNTRY$, in the interest of gaining our acquiescence to their formation of a Greater Germany. There are those within $COUNTRY$ who object, saying that being a German vassal is no better than what we enjoyed previously. But it is something.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME31515;The Greater Germany Question;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC31515;Austrians have always walked a path slightly apart from those of their fellow Germans, and the notion of greater unification has never caught on in Austria as it has in the north. Lately there are those who question that path, citing the ascension of a great power who stands ready to lead us into a Greater Germany. Considering that non-German cultures within Austria would never accept dominance by such a union, and that it would alarm European powers to an unprecedented degree, we have to wonder where our path should now lie?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME31516;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Petitions to Join Germany;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC31516;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government met with the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government in $CAPITAL$ today, expressing their desire to unite into a 'Greater Germany'. They do so with the full intent of incorporating not only their German-speaking territories, but also any lands they own belonging to other cultures. While such a Greater Germany would undoubtedly be a power unheard-of in the world, there are those who express caution: the world's great powers would almost certainly object to such a union, not to mention the fact that the non-Germany cultures would likely rebel against our dominance.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME31518;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Refuses German Unity!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC31518;There has been much talk in $CAPITAL$ in recent days of possible unification with $FROMCOUNTRY$ into a 'Greater Germany'. This talk was finally shot down by the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government, which stated that $FROMCOUNTRY$'s path is separate from $COUNTRY$'s. There are those within the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government, however, who believe this is unacceptable. While it would undoubtedly destroy our relationship with $FROMCOUNTRY$ and upset the powers of Europe, laying a claim to the German-speaking parts of $FROMCOUNTRY$ is a possibility.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC31519;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government met with the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government in $CAPITAL$ today, expressing their desire to unite into a 'Greater Germany'. Their only stipulation on the union is that their non-German states be incorporated as self-governing regions, no doubt to minimize the objection of European powers -- though there are those who believe the European powers will be unhappy with such an arrangement even so.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME31521;The Dissolution of $COUNTRY$;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC31521;Austria is no more. With Vienna gone and what remains of the Empire a disarray of governments unwilling to maintain their cohesion without an Austrian government to hold it together, the nation has split apart at the seams. Whole portions of the Empire have either declared their outright independence or their intention to reunite with their homelands.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTNAME800098;$COUNTRY_ADJ$ Citizens Attacked in $FROMCOUNTRY$;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC800098;Several of our country's citizens have been attacked in the capital of $FROMCOUNTRY$, an incident spurred on by the severe differences between our country's ideology and theirs. The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ has been extremely reluctant to admit any involvement in the affair, and our relations have been hurt as a result.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME2560;The Buffer State;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC2560;This so-called 'buffer state' will not stop us.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT2560OPTA;Enough is enough.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME2600;$STATENAME$ Integration;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC2600;$COUNTRY$ has maintained control over $STATENAME$ for us to consider the possibility of integrating it into $COUNTRY$ as a whole. There are $COUNTRY_ADJ$ flags waving in $PROVINCENAME$, flown by $COUNTRY_ADJ$ citizens, so it does not seem so far-fetched an idea that $STATENAME$ be eventually considered $COUNTRY_ADJ$ territory by the world at large.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME2605;$PROVINCENAME$ Integrated into $COUNTRY$;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC2605;$COUNTRY$ has controlled $PROVINCENAME$ for a long time -- long enough for those within $PROVINCENAME$ to truly consider themselves $COUNTRY_ADJ$ citizens, and for the rest of the world to consider the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ claim to the province to be legitimate as well. Though there are still some unhappy with the development, $PROVINCENAME$ is now considered an integral part of $COUNTRY$.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME2610;$STATENAME$ Assimilation;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC2610;$STATENAME$ is considered $COUNTRY_ADJ$ territory -- that is only in dispute by those neighbors who still have recognized claims on the area, and who maintain that many within $STATENAME$ consider themselves citizens of their country and not ours. The first step in rendering their claim invalid would be to enact a policy that encourages the assimilation of all people within $STATENAME$... they should be $COUNTRY_ADJ$ citizens, and hold no other nationality above ours.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME2611;Assimilation Policies Rescinded;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC2611;With the new government in power and its more liberal views on minorities within $COUNTRY$, the policies of assimilation that attempted to stamp out minorities of other nationalities have all been rescinded. There are those within the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ military who warn that this is a dangerous idea, and that allowing these foreign identities to perpetuate will only lead to further conflict with our neighbors -- but, for now, their voices have been ignored.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME2615;Flags Burned in $PROVINCENAME$;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC2615;A demonstration in $PROVINCENAME$ turned violent as minorities held up $COUNTRY_ADJ$ flags and burned them -- a demonstration of their rejection of our attempts to assimilate them into $COUNTRY$. Authorities broke up the demonstration, but there continues to be a growing discontent in the area. The turmoil has even spread to other citizens, who have begun calling on the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government to end its assimilation policies and let the minority groups be.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME2616;Incident in $PROVINCENAME$;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC2616;The recent arrest of a foreign national in $PROVINCENAME$ has led to a diplomatic incident. Many of the minorities within $PROVINCENAME$ claim that the man was arrested solely because he opposed the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ assimilation policies, and was trying to spread word of a peaceful resistance. The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ authorities say the man's interest was not peaceful in the least, and they suspect he in fact works for one of our neighbors with a claim on $PROVINCENAME$. Whatever the truth, the reaction has not been peaceful in the least -- riots are expected, and authorities say to be wary of rebellion in the area.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME2620;Flags Flying in $PROVINCENAME$!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC2620;A parade has recently taken place in $PROVINCENAME$, with the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ flag flying high -- and being held by people who, until very recently, likely wouldn't have considered themselves $COUNTRY_ADJ$ citizens at all. $PROVINCENAME$ is still claimed by another country, but the acceptance of $PROVINCENAME$'s people is going a long way towards making elimination of that an inevitable fact.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME2625;$PROVINCENAME$ Assimilated!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC2625;The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ flag is the only one that can now be found flying in the streets of $PROVINCENAME$. At long last, it can be considered $COUNTRY_ADJ$ and only $COUNTRY_ADJ$ territory. Even those who are members of other cultures no longer consider themselves truly part of our neighbors -- much as those neighbors might be unhappy with the situation.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME2626;Claims in $FROMCOUNTRY$;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC2626;$FROMCOUNTRY$ continues to hold some of our lands, lands which until today have always been considered part of $COUNTRY_ADJ$ national territory. A $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ program of assimilation has succeeded, however, in weaning our own people away from any feeling as if this true. They no longer consider themselves $COUNTRY_ADJ$, and indeed the international community appears to agree with them.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME2650;$FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ Lands;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC2650;According to our peace treaty with $FROMCOUNTRY$, we must give up lands that rightfully belong to them -- and only the ones that belong to them.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME2651;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ Demand;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC2651;According to our peace treaty with $FROMCOUNTRY$, we must give up lands that rightfully belong to another nation -- but only those lands.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME2660;Our Lands Returned;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC2660;As a result of the treaty with $FROMCOUNTRY$, some of $COUNTRY$'s lands are to be returned. We are, however, only entitled to those lands over which we have a claim. Any others should, by all rights, be returned to $FROMCOUNTRY$. \n \n §RNOTE: If you took $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ core provinces which are not also your own core provinces in this war, enacting the 'return' option will give those lands back. Be careful!§W;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT2600OPTA;We should begin integrating $STATENAME$.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVT2600OPTB;Let $STATENAME$ remain separate, for now.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTNAME98300;War-Time Election;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC98300;As the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ election begins, the people are all too keenly aware that the nation exists in a state of war. Debates in $CAPITAL$ rage over the state of the war, though the overwhelming feeling is that now more than ever citizens should be supporting the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government. Still, there are some who believe that now is the perfect time for change.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME98301;Violent Elections;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC98301;As the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ election begins, there is a general sense that things are not going to proceed smoothly. A sense of change is in the air, and while not everyone wants that change it seems there are many who have leapt upon the election as a chance to make it happen. A recent riot in $CAPITAL$ was only barely kept under control, and debates elsewhere in $COUNTRY$ are threatening to erupt into further violence as neither side is willing to budge.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME98302;Anger Against the Government;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC98302;$COUNTRY$ has its share of problems -- and as the current election gets underway, there is a sense among many that the current government is to blame. Justified or not, that anger has instilled a sense that a regime change may be in the offing. Those who previously had never considered voting for any other party than the one in power are now considering doing just that.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME98303;Contentious Election;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC98303;As the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ election gets underway, it becomes clear it will be a contentious one. The issues are clear and the battle lines between parties drawn, and there are those who believe that while violence may not be the result the toppling of the current $COUNTRY_ADJ$ regime could be.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME98304;Government Supporters Rally;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC98304;With the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ election underway, supporters of the current regime have rallied in $CAPITAL$. They claim that stability is required to deal with the problems facing $COUNTRY$, and are actively trying to shout down opposition. Whether this will mean a victory in the current election is unknown.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME98305;Orderly Election;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC98305;The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ election is underway, and so far has proceeded smoothly.

EVTNAME1600010;The Taiping Rebellion;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC1600010;It is as we feared -- the so-called 'Heavenly Kingdom' has assumed control of lands in the south, and any attempts by the local governors to resume authority have failed. It is an embarrassment to the prestige of the Imperial throne that we must deign to recognize that these rebels exist and must be dealt with once and for all. Some are even beginning to question the Mandate of Heaven if such a threat is possible.

EVTDESC1605020;After a period of self-enforced isolation, Hong Xiuquan has died -- some say of poison, others of illness. Regardless of the cause, the nation has been thrown into mourning for their beloved leader. Hong Xiuquan's son, Hong Tianguifu, is ready to step into his father's role as leader, but there are some who fear he will be unsuitable. They are advocating a restoration of the Qing dynasty. Others say that $COUNTRY$ must become a republic, in emulation of western powers. Whether $COUNTRY$ is ready for such a change is difficult to say.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTDESC16050214;With our holdings on the mainland lost, all we have left is our stronghold on the island of Taiwan. The suggestion among what little remains of the Kuomintang government is that we abandon $CAPITAL$ and move the capital to Taipei. This does not guarantee our safety by any means, but it may be the only means of survival we possess.  We shall however never relinquish our rightful claim to the mainland.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTNAME164503;The Heavenly Kingdom;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC164503;A troublemaker has arisen in the southern lands. According to reports, this man claims to have received a vision to the effect that he is the younger brother of Jesus Christ and was sent to rid China of the corrupt Manchu Qing Dynasty rulers. He has been winning converts to Christianity, and it seems there are many willing to listen to his words of sedition and join his so-called 'Heavenly Kingdom'.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTDESC164601;Revolutionaries seeking to bring down the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ monarchy have been stirring up a revolt in $STATENAME$.

EVTNAME99000;The Righteous Harmony Society;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC99000;'Support the Qing! Destroy the Foreign!' \n \n Many Chinese are growing enraged at the continuing encroachment of westerners into the Empire. They walk freely, spread Christianity with impunity, and ignore Imperial laws. A movement called the Righteous Harmony Society -- known to foreigners as 'Boxers' -- has appeared, their mission to drive western influence out of the Qing Empire by any means necessary. Some are worried that attacks upon westerners could bring foreign anger down upon us, but there are those who see this as a good thing. Anger against westerners, even if it means a degree of chaos and disruption in our provinces, means support for the Qing government.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
EVTNAME99001;Boxers in $STATENAME$;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC99001;An attack upon a foreign merchant in $PROVINCENAME$ has signaled the arrival of the Boxer movement to $STATENAME$.

EVTDESC99005;Throughout all of $STATENAME$, the Boxers are attacking western influence.

We have a choice: either look the other way, risking anger from the great powers for these 'atrocities', or send in forces to suppress the Boxers and risk the anger of our own people.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME99006;Boxer Atrocities in $FROMCOUNTRY$;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC99006;A group of Chinese nationalists known as the 'Boxers', intent on driving all western influence out of $FROMCOUNTRY$, have attacked a group of $COUNTRY_ADJ$ citizens. Several were slain, while others were forced to flee for their lives. Worse, the Qing government has done nothing about it. They are looking the other way while these atrocities are being committed upon our people.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME99010;Boxers Attack Legation Quarter!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC99010;The Boxers have reached the capital of $COUNTRY$, streaming into $CAPITAL$ to attack foreigners -- and, far more noteworthy, they have laid siege to the Legation Quarter. Hundreds of foreign dignitaries and merchants reside within. If we do not step in to protect them, it will be seen as a declaration of support for the Boxers and an act of war against the great powers. If we do, the Boxers will see it as a betrayal of their cause and perhaps even rise up in rebellion against us. They have forced our hand now, however, and we have no choice but to act.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,
EVTNAME99011;Boxers Attack $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Legation;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC99011;The Boxer situation in $FROMCOUNTRY$ has reached a head: the Chinese nationalists have entered Peking, laying siege to the Legation Quarter and putting the lives of dozes of $COUNTRY_ADJ$ merchants and dignitaries at risk. The Qing government has looked the other way, an act that is seen by the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government as a declaration of war. Many are calling upon us to intervene in order to protect $COUNTRY_ADJ$ citizens from these barbarians.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME99015;The Boxer Protocol;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC99015;We are forced to submit to the foreign demands, signing a treaty with the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ generals and representatives from all the great powers.

When a Japanese soldier, Private Shimura Kikujiro, failed to return to his post, Chinese regimental commander Ji Xingwen received a message from the Japanese demanding permission to enter Wanping to search for the missing soldier. The Chinese refused. Although Private Shimura returned to his unit, by this point both sides were mobilising, with the Japanese deploying reinforcements and surrounding Wanping.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTNAME1316081;The Kowloon Incident;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC1316081;A drunken riot by a large group of British sailors ashore at Kowloon has resulted in the death of a local man. By rights, the sailors should be tried and executed by the Qing magistrate. The British, however, have demanded extraterritoriality -- meaning their citizens would be tried by British judges. This will inevitably lead to their release and the anger of our citizens, but demanding these men executions could lead to war.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While we could drag the war on and see if the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ have the wherewithal to finish their assault, it might be in our best interest to give them a concession port and reparations.

Indeed, $COUNTRY_ADJ$ nationals throughout $FROMCOUNTRY$ are reporting harassment and outright violence. $COUNTRY_ADJ$ are being refused berth at Chinese harbors. This is a systematic campaign by the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ emperor to reduce our influence.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME1316180;Empire of the Great Qing;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC1316180;China has no need for, nor interest in, foreigners and their gifts no matter how ingenious they may be.

EVTNAME131709;The Kowloon Incident;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC131709;An incident that began with drunken sailors murdering a Chinese man has escalated into a larger crisis with the Qing government. We have insisted that these sailors be tried by a British judge -- the barbaric Chinese judicial system would result in these men getting anything but a fair trial. The Chinese have demanded the men be turned over, and what's more that they be given the right to punish British citizens as needed. The confrontation has resulted in larger trade sanctions being applied against British merchants, and threats of worse.

EVTDESC13005;The Irish Civil War  was a conflict that followed the Irish War of Independence and accompanied the establishment of the Irish Free State, an entity independent from the United Kingdom but within the British Empire. The civil war was waged between two opposing groups, the pro-treaty Provisional Government and the anti-treaty IRA, over the Anglo-Irish Treaty. The forces of the Provisional Government (which became the Free State in December 1922) supported the Treaty, while the anti-treaty opposition saw it as a betrayal of the Irish Republic (which had been proclaimed during the Easter Rising). Many of those who fought on both sides in the conflict had been members of the Irish Republican Army (Old IRA) during the War of Independence. The Civil War was won by the pro-treaty Free State forces, who benefited from substantial quantities of weapons provided by the British Government. The conflict may have claimed more lives than the War of Independence that preceded it, and left Irish society divided and embittered for generations.

His insistence on road construction and the creation of jobs in the then-new oil industry promoted population mobility and more frequent social contact among Venezuelans of different regions - previously a rare occurrence - which permanently rooted a sense of national unity in the country.

EVTDESC4003001;La Violencia was a ten-year civil war in Colombia from 1948 to 1958, between the Colombian Conservative Party and the Colombian Liberal Party, fought mainly in the countryside. La Violencia is considered to have begun with the April 9th, 1948 assassination of Jorge Eliecer Gaitan, a Liberal Party presidential candidate for the 1949 November election. His murder provoked the Bogotazo rioting, which lasted ten hours and resulted in around 5,000 casualties. An alternative historiography proposes the Conservative party's return to power following the election of 1946 to be the cause. Rural town police and political leaders encouraged Conservative-supporting peasants to seize the agricultural lands of Liberal-supporting peasants, which provoked peasant-to-peasant violence throughout Colombia.

The original timetable, announced in June 1976, called for a transition that was to culminate in presidential elections in February 1978. First, new government charters and electoral laws were to be drafted by appointed commissions, and then a public referendum would choose between two proposed constitutions. The transition was repeatedly slowed down, however, and in the end, instead of the less than two years originally scheduled, three years and eight months elapsed between the 1976 coup and the inauguration of a civilian president.;;;;;;;;;;X

Franco was overthrown on August 13, 1937, but his influence and that of febreiristas continued to influence Paraguayan politics and eventually led to the Paraguayan Civil war of 1947 and establishment of Revolutionary Febrerista Party in 1951.

EVTDESC8004100;The Cyprus Emergency was a conflict fought in British Cyprus between 1955 and 1959. The National Organisation of Cypriot Fighters (EOKA), a Greek Cypriot right-wing nationalist guerrilla organisation, began an armed campaign in support of the end of British colonial rule and the unification of Cyprus and Greece (Enosis) in 1955. Opposition to Enosis from Turkish Cypriots led to the formation of the Turkish Resistance Organisation (TMT) in support of the partition of Cyprus. The Cyprus Emergency ended in 1959 with the signature of the London-Zürich Agreements, establishing the Republic of Cyprus as a non-partitioned independent state separate from Greece.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC8004101;King Paul of Greece declared that Cyprus desired union with Greece in 1948. A referendum was presented by the Orthodox Church of Cyprus in 1950, according to which around 97% of the Greek Cypriot population wanted the union. The Greek petition and enosis became an international issue when it was accepted by the United Nations. Signed on 19 February 1959, the London and Zurich Agreements started the process for the constitution of an independent Cyprus. The United Kingdom granted independence to Cyprus on 16 August 1960 and formed the Republic of Cyprus. Archbishop Makarios III, a charismatic religious and political leader, was elected as the first president of independent Cyprus. As part of the independence agreement, the United Kingdom retained possession of the Sovereign Base Areas of Akrotiri and Dhekelia as a British Overseas Territory.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC8004110;Greece had established a national policy of enosis to achieve the island's union with Greece since the 1950s. After 1964, the Greek government tried to control Makarios' policies, and following his unwillingness to obey Athens, attempted to destabilise his government. While the Greek policy shifted to a more cooperative one after 1967, when an extremist military junta took power in Greece, it supported the far-right EOKA-B group against Makarios. Dimitrios Ioannidis, the de facto leader of the junta, believed that Makarios was no longer a true supporter of enosis, and suspected him of being a communist sympathiser. Between 1971 and 1974, five plans were prepared by the Greek government to overthrow Makarios' government.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC8004111;The coup was ordered by Dimitrios Ioannidis, the shadow leader of the Greek junta, and Greek officers led the Cypriot National Guard to capture the Presidential Palace in Nicosia. The building was almost entirely burned down. Makarios narrowly escaped death in the attack. He fled the presidential palace from its back door and went to Paphos, where the British managed to retrieve him in the afternoon of 16 July and flew him from Akrotiri to Malta. The newly established regime has been described as an extremist puppet regime of the Greek junta. On 15 July, between 8 am and 9 am, the coup leaders proclaimed their victory on the state channel Cyprus Broadcasting Corporation. In response, Rauf Denktas, the leader of the Turkish Cypriot Administration, stated that he believed that the events were among Greek Cypriots and called for Turkish Cypriots not to go out, as well as for UNFICYP to take extensive security measures for Turkish Cypriots.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC8004112;The Cypriot coup had been ordered by the military Junta in Greece and staged by the Cypriot National Guard in conjunction with EOKA-B. It deposed the Cypriot president Archbishop Makarios III and installed Nikos Sampson. The aim of the coup was the union (enosis) of Cyprus with Greece, and the Hellenic Republic of Cyprus to be declared. In July 1974, Turkish forces invaded and captured 3% of the island before a ceasefire was declared. The Greek military junta collapsed and was replaced by a democratic government. In August 1974 another Turkish invasion resulted in the capture of approximately 36% of the island. The ceasefire line from August 1974 became the United Nations Buffer Zone in Cyprus and is commonly referred to as the Green Line.;;;;;;;;;;X

EVTDESC8004114;At the second Geneva Conference on 9 August, Turkey pressed for a federal solution to the problem against stiffening Greek resistance. Whilst Turkish Cypriots wanted a bi-zonal federation, Turkey, under American advice, submitted a cantonal plan involving separation of Turkish-Cypriot areas from one another. For security reasons Turkish-Cypriots did not favour cantons. Each plan embraced about thirty-four per cent of the territory. These plans were presented to the conference on 13 August by the Turkish Foreign Minister, Turan Güne?. Clerides wanted thirty-six to forty-eight hours to consider the plans, but Güne? demanded an immediate response. This was regarded as unreasonable by the Greeks, the British and the Americans who were in close consultation. Nevertheless, the next day, the Turkish forces extended their control to some 36 per cent of the island. they were afraid that delay would turn international opinion strongly against them if Greek spoiling tactics were given a chance and they were determined to come to the rescue of greatly threatened Turkish Cypriots whose enclaves were still occupied by Greek forces.;;;;;;;;;;X

EVTNAME70010;The Effects of our Political Propaganda;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC70010;Propaganda has become more common in political contexts, in particular to refer to certain efforts sponsored by governments, political groups, but also often covert interests. In the early 20th century, propaganda was exemplified in the form of party slogans. Propaganda also has much in common with public information campaigns by governments, which are intended to encourage or discourage certain forms of behavior (such as wearing seat belts, not smoking, not littering and so forth). Again, the emphasis is more political in propaganda. Propaganda can take the form of leaflets, posters, TV and radio broadcasts and can also extend to any other medium. In the case of the United States, there is also an important legal (imposed by law) distinction between advertising (a type of overt propaganda) and what the Government Accountability Office (GAO), an arm of the United States Congress, refers to as "covert propaganda".;;;;;;;;;;X

During the Cold War era, Turkey saw political violence (1976–1980) between far-left and far-right and islamist militant groups and the state. The violence saw a sharp downturn for a period after the coup, which was welcomed by some for restoring order by quickly executing 50 people and arresting 500,000, hundreds of whom would die in prison. For the next three years the Turkish Armed Forces ruled the country through the National Security Council, before democracy was restored with the 1983 Turkish general election.

Gombos advocated a one-party government, revision of the Treaty of Trianon, withdrawal from the League of Nations, anti-intellectualism, and social reform. He assembled a political machine, but his efforts to fashion a one-party state and fulfill his reform platform were frustrated by a parliament composed mostly of Bethlen's supporters and by Hungary's creditors, who forced Gombos to follow conventional policies in dealing with the economic and financial crisis.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
